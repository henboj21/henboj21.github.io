<p>I have liked crystals for about a year now.I mean how can i not?They are all so special and uniqe, each and everyone of them has dífferent patterns,different meanings ect.
And one day i decided to buy one myself.Unfortunately, since i lived in Montenegro,there werent any crystal shops.I tried to find one but there werent any.And most people dont trust  online shops  because usually the crystals you buy are either fake or really expensive.
Thats why i decided to open my own online shop, where i can guarantee real crystals for a really low price!
And of course i named it after my favourite cartoon: Steven universe.Which is where i first heard about crystals.</p>
